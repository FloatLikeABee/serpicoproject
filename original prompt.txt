I wanna start this new project called Serpico (an AI Agent assistant helper APP for police forces on patrol or in office use; for civilians it's an app for checking nearby safety status with AI)
* This is version 0.1 - a demo and basic framework for the final product
* frontend ui in reactjs (mobile compatible)
* create docs and Readme in the root
* backend use Golang for faster API builds, goroutine uses and embedded DBs (should have key-value cache DB)

* first create a good design based on the "granddesign.PNG" rough graph, put the design into doc file.
* then start developement. frontend UI need to have light/dark mode, backend apis must have swaggerUI for access.

* user login page should only be a mock, having email and password, or sign in with google/apple. but everything is a mock so user can just hit login button and login.
* Modules:
	
	for cops:
		- In pursue (ongoing cases or pursues on a map canvas, sided with real time AI chat suggestions on nearby perps, prompts should be organized in the backend. AI provides recommendation pursue routes from history data)
		- Perps (AI chat with a base of perps from cases in recent 3 years, the year range is configurable.)
		- Case library (chat with AI for historical cases in the area, AI agents with search and wiki. including unsolved. focus on armed/unarmed assults, sexual assults, murders and robberies.)
		- emergency notification / 911 dispatch (AI categoried and suggestions by category by the rank/ability set of the officer, and real-time location)
		- Leisure (AI chat for after hour workouts, training info, healthcare advices specifically for police forces, bars and clubs, social activities. AI agent with search tool should be used.)
		
	for civilians:
		- Nearby officers/police vehicles, and possible danger like a pursue or discovered criminal activity (AI chat display on a map canvas, sided by a drawer button when opened it's the AI chat, listing officer names/ranks/vehicle plate/number)
		- Nearby perps/criminals/convicts in recent history (not the actual faces or names because it could be a violation, but recent events with covered names, unless the perp is on the public list from the police dept.)
		- Recommendations on safe routes to a destination.
		- crime notification for nearby civilians.
		
* App default home to be a map canvas, for police it should be "In pursue", for civilians it's Nearby officers/police vehicles and possible danger like a pursue or discovered criminal activity. The map canvas should be accompanied by AI chat from a drawer button.
* Settings module is common for both, to set user data and the theme of the APP.

* logo design: Serpico should be a shield, like the shield of Captain America. the color of the App should be red and blue as well, but not really sharp, make it eye friendly.
